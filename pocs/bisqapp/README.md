# Bisq Mobile (Full/Light-node option)

This project aims to make Bisq Network accesible in Mobile Platforms following the philosofy of Bisq2 - to make it
easier for both, experienced and newcomers, to trade Bitcoin in a decentralized way.

Currently, this project is a playground to start a POC with the following goals:

- Focus on Android first
- Have a general look and feel native to Android and respectful of Bisq2
- Minimal usable functionality for the mobile world: focus on transacting in Bisq using Mobile and just that and its
  UX (e.g. add push notifications).
- Able to connect to Bisq Network **as a node** using clearnet (and soon after, with Tor)

For more info please refer to [Bisq Mobile Discussions](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/discussions/2665)
