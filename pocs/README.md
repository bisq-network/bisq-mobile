Currently, this project is a playground to start a POC with the following goals:

- Focus on Android first
- Have a general look and feel native to Android and respectful of Bisq2
- Minimal usable functionality for the mobile world: focus on transacting in Bisq using Mobile and just that and its
  UX (e.g. add push notifications).
- Able to connect to Bisq Network using clearnet (and soon after, with Tor)
