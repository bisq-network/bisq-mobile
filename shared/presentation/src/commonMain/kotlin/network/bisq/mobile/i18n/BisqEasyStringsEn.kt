This does not apply if the trade peer is unresponsive.\n - During Fiat payment, the buyer MUST NOT include terms like 'Bisq' or 'Bitcoin' in the 'reason for payment' field. Traders can agree on an identifier, such as a random string like 'H3TJAPD', to associate the bank transfer with the trade.\n - If the trade cannot be completed instantly due to longer Fiat transfer times, both traders must be online at least once a day to monitor the trade progress.\n - In the event that traders encounter unresolved issues, they have the option to invite a mediator into the trade chat for assistance.\n\n Should you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to visit the chat rooms accessible under the 'Support' menu.
