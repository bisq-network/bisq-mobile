This does not apply if the trade peer is unresponsive.\n - During Fiat payment, the buyer MUST NOT include terms like 'Bisq' or 'Bitcoin' in the 'reason for payment' field. Traders can agree on an identifier, such as a random string like 'H3TJAPD', to associate the bank transfer with the trade.\n - If the trade cannot be completed instantly due to longer Fiat transfer times, both traders must be online at least once a day to monitor the trade progress.\n - In the event that traders encounter unresolved issues, they have the option to invite a mediator into the trade chat for assistance.\n\n Should you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to visit the chat rooms accessible under the 'Support' menu.

You can move the address to your PC by scanning the QR code with a camera, by sending the address with an email or chat message, or even by simply typing it.\n\n Once you complete the trade, Bluewallet will notice the incoming Bitcoin and update your balance with the new funds.
