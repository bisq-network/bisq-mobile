## How to contribute

## Why KMP

- Native Performance
- Allows us to focus on the "easiest" platform first (Because of Apple restrictions on Tor and networking in general)
- Flexibility without the security/privacy concerns of its competitors
- JVM language allows us to port much of the optimised Bisq code already existing in the Desktop apps
