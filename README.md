# Bisq Mobile

## Goal

This project aims to make Bisq Network accesible in Mobile Platforms following the philosofy of Bisq2 - to make it
easier for both, experienced and newcomers, to trade Bitcoin in a decentralized way as well as defending Bisq motto: exchange, decentralized, private & secure.

To achieve this goal, we are building a total of 3 mobile apps that can be divided in 2 categories:

### Run a Bisq (Easy) Node in Mobile

 - An Android app (called `androidNode`) that runs bisq core in its veins aiming to bring a fully featured trading version of `Bisq2` (also referred to as its main protocol - `Bisq Easy`) to Mobile for full privacy & security.

### Share a trusted Bisq Node

 - A thin Bisq App `Client` (coming in `android` & `iOS` flavours) able to be configured to connect to a trusted Bisq node (over clearnet) to cater for people willing to try Bisq from somebody they really trust (popularily described as "Uncle Jim") who is willing to share his Bisq node with them.
